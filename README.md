# CS255-DriverPass-Portfolio
Portfolio for CS 255 DriverPass Project
  The DriverPass project involved designing a system for DriverPass, a company addressing the 65% DMV driving test failure rate by providing online practice exams, in-person lessons, and on-the-road training. The client, led by Liam (owner) and Ian (IT officer), required a cloud-based, web-accessible system to manage lesson bookings, deliver DMV-compliant practice tests, track user activities, and support offline report viewing. The system needed to serve customers, secretaries, admins, and IT officers, with integration to the DMV for real-time rule updates.
  I excelled in creating comprehensive and structured documents that clearly translated the client’s needs into actionable requirements and technical designs. The Business Requirements Document effectively captured functional and nonfunctional requirements, such as role-based access and performance metrics (e.g., 2-second booking response time), while the System Design Document provided detailed UML diagrams (Use Case, Activity, Sequence, and Class) to illustrate system interactions and architecture. My ability to align these documents with the interview transcript ensured all stakeholder needs were addressed, particularly the flexibility to modify training packages without code changes.
  If I could revise one part, I would enhance the Limitations section of the Business Requirements Document. While it addressed constraints like the project timeline (Jan 22–May 10, 2025) and DMV API dependency, I would improve it by quantifying potential scalability limits (e.g., maximum concurrent users) and proposing mitigation strategies, such as load testing or phased feature rollouts. This would provide a clearer roadmap for handling growth beyond the initial 10 cars and drivers.
  Interpreting user needs involved analyzing the interview transcript to identify key requirements, such as secure access, DMV integration, and offline reporting. These were implemented through a relational database for data management, a web-based interface for accessibility, and role-based access control for security. For example, customers needed intuitive booking and test-taking features, while admins required reporting tools. Considering user needs is critical because it ensures the system is usable, meets expectations, and supports the client’s business goals, reducing the risk of costly redesigns or user dissatisfaction.
  My approach to designing software emphasizes iterative analysis and structured documentation. I begin by gathering requirements through stakeholder interviews, then use UML diagrams to model workflows, interactions, and data structures. For the DriverPass system, I prioritized modularity (e.g., cloud-based backend) and scalability (e.g., CDN for performance). In the future, I would employ additional techniques like prototyping to validate user interfaces early, conducting user acceptance testing to refine requirements, and leveraging agile methodologies to adapt to changing needs. These strategies ensure a robust, user-focused design that balances technical feasibility with client expectations.
